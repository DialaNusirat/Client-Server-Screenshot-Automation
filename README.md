# Client-Server-Screenshot-Automation
This project demonstrates a client-server application built using Python to automate the process of taking screenshots on a server machine remotely. The system is designed to run in a local network environment and allows secure communication between the client and server for task execution.
Key Features
Remote Command Execution: The client sends commands to the server, including taking screenshots and controlling the server's behavior (e.g., shutting down the server).
Screenshot Automation: The server captures screenshots of its display using the Pillow library and saves them locally.
JSON-Based Communication: All commands and responses are exchanged in JSON format for clarity and ease of extension.
Robust Error Handling: The system gracefully handles invalid commands and errors during execution.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for both client and server implementations.
Socket Programming: Enables seamless communication between the client and server.
Pillow (PIL): Used for screenshot capture on the server.
How It Works
The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port (default: 80).
The client connects to the server and sends JSON-formatted commands (e.g., {"action": "take_screenshot"}).
The server processes the command, executes the requested task, and sends back a response.
Usage
Run the server:
python server.py
Run the client:
python client.py
Use the client's interactive menu to send commands to the server.
Future Enhancements
Add authentication to secure communication.
Support for additional commands, such as file transfer or monitoring.
Extend compatibility across platforms.
